# Sleep Alert For Cars
## Overview
This project implements a drowsiness detection system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system analyzes a live video stream from a webcam to identify signs of drowsiness in a person's eyes. When drowsiness is detected, the system triggers notifications and activates a buzzer to alert the user.






## Features

- Drowsiness detection using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- Integration with Pushbullet for real-time notifications.
- Buzzer activation for immediate alerts.
- Video stream analysis for continuous monitoring.
- Optimised for Raspberry Pi Zero.
